  Switch-GreenroomSession decides a direction and then acts, so the tests that matter
  are about WHICH direction and WHEN the decision is made.

  The stale-read case is the reason Test-WindowVisible exists as a private wrapper at
  all: Pester cannot mock a static .NET method, so with the P/Invoke called inline
  there would be no way to prove the read happens at the point of decision rather than
  during discovery.
