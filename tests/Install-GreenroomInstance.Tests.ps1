  Install is the most dangerous command here, and almost all of that danger lives in
  Resolve-InstallParameter: installing is documented as idempotent, so a bare re-run
  that quietly changes something the operator never mentioned is a betrayal of that
  promise. Every rule below is a bug that actually happened on the reference host.

  These are pinned against a real config.json in a temp state root, because "does a
  bare re-run inherit what the last one wrote" is a question about a file.
