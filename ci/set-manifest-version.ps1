  Write the version AND that version's release notes into the manifest, as a cog
  pre-bump hook.

  WHY THE NOTES LIVE IN THE MANIFEST. PrivateData.PSData.ReleaseNotes is what the
  PowerShell Gallery renders on a version's page, and it is the only thing a person
  browsing the gallery can read to decide whether to upgrade. A module that ships it empty
  -- or points at a changelog somewhere else -- is the package equivalent of an app store
  entry that says "bug fixes and improvements", and that is a failure of tooling rather
  than a fact about the release. Every version this repository publishes carries its own
  changes.

  A published version is PERMANENT: the gallery allows unlisting, not deleting. So the
  notes have to be right on the way out, not fixable afterwards.

  ORDER. cog runs pre-bump hooks BEFORE it writes the changelog, commits or tags, so the
  new tag does not exist yet and `git describe` still names the PREVIOUS release. That is
  exactly the range we want: previous tag..HEAD.

  Both values go in ONE Update-ModuleManifest call, which is PowerShell's own writer for
  the manifest -- nothing here hand-edits a psd1.

  Verified before adopting it: multi-line notes containing apostrophes, asterisks, parens
  and `#` round-trip through Update-ModuleManifest intact and leave the manifest valid.
  The only difference is line endings, which it normalises to CRLF.

  FAILS RATHER THAN SHIPPING EMPTY NOTES. A hook that throws aborts the bump before the
  commit and tag exist, which is the safe side of the point of no return.

# Drop cog's own heading -- it reads "## Unreleased (abc..def)", which is both wrong on a
# published version and redundant beside the version the gallery already shows.
#
# Then drop the version-bump commit. It is the release's own bookkeeping ("- (**version**)
# v0.2.0"), it is never what a reader wants to know, and dropping it is what makes the
# emptiness check below mean something.
# @() around every pipeline, and Select-Object -Skip rather than a range slice. Both are
# load-bearing in PowerShell and were verified rather than assumed:
#   - a pipeline yielding ONE item collapses to a [string], and indexing a string returns
#     CHARACTERS, which silently corrupts the heading pass below
#   - `1..($n-1)` with $n=1 expands to `1,0` -- DESCENDING -- so the slice keeps the very
#     line it was meant to drop
# Neither shows up on a normal release; both would land on an odd one, permanently.

# WRITTEN FOR THE PERSON READING THE GALLERY PAGE, not for someone with the repository
# open. Surveyed what comparable modules actually ship in this field: PSReadLine,
# PSScriptAnalyzer and ImportExcel ship it EMPTY; Pester and dbatools ship a bare link;
# Az.Accounts -- the best of them, and the most installed module there is -- ships plain
# readable bullets. None of the six carry commit hashes or author names.
#
# So drop both. The gallery renders this close to plain text, which makes a hash
# unclickable noise, and per-line attribution answers a question the reader is not asking:
# they want to know what changed, and the git detail is one click away in the full
# changelog linked at the end.
#
# Pull request numbers are KEPT, deliberately, as the one deviation. They cost four
# characters and, beside that link, are enough to find the discussion behind a change.

# MEASURED, and the reason this check is not a formality: for a degenerate range -- HEAD
# already at the previous tag -- cog does not emit nothing. It emits the PREVIOUS release's

# up describing a release that already shipped. Require an actual entry instead.
