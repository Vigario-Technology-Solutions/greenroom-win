  Supervisor for one greenroom instance.

  Requirement: the session is not allowed to be down. If the Windows Terminal
  window is closed accidentally instead of detached, the session must come back
  within a second or two, without any window ever appearing.

  Design:
    - This watchdog is itself launched hidden by greenroom-watchdog.vbs (wscript
      is GUI-subsystem, and Run(cmd,0,False) passes SW_HIDE at process creation).
    - It launches the session as a Windows Terminal window that is ALSO born
      hidden, via Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden. WT honours it, and the
      hidden window can still be revealed later by greenroom.ps1.
    - It watches the claude.exe PID directly. Get-Process -Id is cheap enough to
      poll once a second; the expensive CIM query only runs on a restart.

  Windows Terminal is required rather than conhost: conhost does no font
  fallback, and no console-registerable font contains the glyphs the TUI draws.

  MULTI-INSTANCE: every process lookup is filtered on '--remote-control <name>'
  so several instances can be supervised on one host without stealing each
  other's sessions. A watchdog that matched bare '--remote-control' would adopt
  whichever session it saw first and then fight the other watchdog over it.

# SINGLE-INSTANCE GUARD.
#
# Exactly one watchdog may supervise an instance. Two is not merely redundant:
# when the session dies they both see it inside the same 1s poll and both call
# Start-RcSession, producing two Windows Terminal windows carrying the SAME
# --name. Resolution then finds two matches, refuses, and attach breaks
# permanently with nothing on screen to explain it.
#
# This is easy to reach by accident. Stop-ScheduledTask is a no-op against this
# architecture -- the task runs wscript.exe, which spawns the watchdog detached
# and returns, so the task sits at Ready with nothing left to stop. A plain
# Start-ScheduledTask therefore ADDS a supervisor. Measured on the reference
# host: 1 watchdog, Stop-ScheduledTask, still 1, Start-ScheduledTask, 2.
#
# A named mutex rather than a process scan, deliberately. Scanning races: two
# watchdogs starting together can both look, both see nothing, and both proceed.
# The mutex is a kernel object, so the check and the claim are one atomic step.
# It is also self-cleaning -- if the holder is killed, its handle closes and the
# claim is released, so a crashed watchdog never locks the instance out.
#
# Local\ not Global\: instances run in the interactive user's session, and
# Global\ would let one user's watchdog block another's on a shared machine.

# Windows Terminal keeps a window alive when the process hosting its tab dies
# abruptly rather than exiting. The window stays enumerable, frozen at whatever
# title it had at death. Killing claude.exe does NOT do this -- the launcher then
# exits normally and the window closes with it -- but killing the launcher shell
# does, and so does any abnormal termination of it.
#
# For greenroom that corpse is not cosmetic. It holds "<glyph> <instance>", which
# is exactly the title the replacement session will have, so greenroom.ps1 finds
# two windows matching one name, refuses to choose, and attach breaks permanently
# with nothing on screen to explain it.
#
# This runs only from Start-RcSession, which is reached only after Get-RcClaudePid
# has confirmed no live session for this instance. Any window still bearing the
# instance name at that moment is therefore stale by definition. Combined with the
# single-instance mutex, no other watchdog can be launching a replacement
# concurrently, so there is nothing live to mistake for a corpse.
#
# PostMessage, not SendMessage: PostMessage returns immediately, so an unresponsive
# window cannot block the supervisor. Closing is best-effort by design.
