  Every running greenroom session on this host, as process records.

  Anchors on claude.exe itself rather than on a launcher. Two earlier approaches
  failed: matching pwsh by command line also matched shells that merely MENTIONED
  "--remote-control" (diagnostics included), and searching a launcher's descendants
  missed the window entirely, because Windows Terminal is parented to the
  console-handoff broker rather than to us.

  Renamed from Get-AllSessions: PSUseSingularNouns is a real rule for a module's
  functions, and it was one of the exclusions the script shape needed.

    # Claude Desktop runs a dozen unrelated claude.exe (13 on the reference host), and
    # calling one of those a probable greenroom session would be the confident wrong
    # answer this branch exists to avoid.
