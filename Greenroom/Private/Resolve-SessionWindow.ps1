  Resolve an instance's window from the handle the watchdog recorded when it created
  that window. That record is the ONLY source; there is deliberately no fallback.

  Windows Terminal hosts every window in one process and exposes no supported way to
  map a hosted process to its window (microsoft/terminal#5694, Won't Fix), so anything
  other than the record is inference from the window title -- and the title belongs to
  Claude Code, not to greenroom. A session sitting at a trust prompt or a /login screen
  has not applied --name yet and has no matching title at all, which is exactly when
  the operator needs to attach.

  A title fallback would paper over that, and would also hide the failure that matters:
  capture silently not working looks healthy right up until the day it resolves someone
  else's window.

  The record is validated, never trusted. Windows reuses handles after a window closes,
  so a stale record can name a live window belonging to something else.

  Returns the handle, or $null with the reason on the Verbose stream. It does not
  write to the host: a resolver that prints is unusable from Get-GreenroomInstance,
  which needs to report "unresolved" for one instance without spraying advice about it.
