  Prove a model value works before it can reach a launch line.

  An unusable --model is FATAL and silent: claude exits 1 at once, the launcher records it,
  the watchdog never sees a session come up, and the crash-loop guard eventually trips --
  all inside a hidden window. Same failure class as a CLI without --remote-control, so it
  is checked the same way, by running the thing.

  MEASURED on the reference host:
    claude --model definitely-not-a-real-model-xyz --print  -> exit 1, "There's an issue
                                                               with the selected model"
    claude --model opus --print                             -> exit 0
    claude --model <anything> --version                     -> exit 0 EITHER WAY

  That last line is why this costs an API call: --version short-circuits and validates
  nothing, so there is no free probe. The caller therefore runs this only when -Model was
  passed EXPLICITLY, never when it was inherited from the previous install.
