  Work out the settings an install should actually use, by merging what was passed
  with what the previous install of this instance recorded.

  THIS IS THE MOST DANGEROUS FUNCTION IN THE MODULE, and every rule in it is a bug
  that happened. Installing is documented as idempotent and safe to re-run, so a bare
  re-run that quietly changed something the operator never mentioned is a betrayal of
  that promise -- and each of these did exactly that:

    -WorkingDirectory   omitted, it fell back to ~/<instance>, RELOCATING the
                        instance: new directory created, trust seeded for it, session
                        restarted there, abandoning the real working directory along
                        with its project store, memory and transcripts. Reproduced on
                        two instances at once.
    -TriggerDelay       omitted, it reset a deliberately staggered PT3M to PT1M,
                        un-staggering a multi-instance host.
    -AdditionalDirectories omitted, it rebuilt the grant list as empty and wrote that
                        through to config.json, the project settings and the launch
                        line, silently revoking access.
    -ClaudeExe          a deliberate choice reverted to auto-detection.
    -Elevated           dropped, leaving an instance that still looks installed and
                        fails later with Access Denied inside a hidden window.

  Passing a parameter is always authoritative. Omitting it inherits. Clearing is
  explicit: -AdditionalDirectories @() and -ClaudeExe ''.

  Returns a settings object; writes nothing.
