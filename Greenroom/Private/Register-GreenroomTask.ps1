  Register (or replace) the logon task that supervises an instance.

  The task runs wscript.exe against the .vbs shipped in this module's Assets folder.
  wscript is a GUI-subsystem binary, so Run(cmd, 0, False) passes SW_HIDE in
  STARTUPINFO at PROCESS CREATION -- the whole reason it is there. Hiding a console
  from inside the process is too late: the OS creates the window visible and pwsh needs
  ~370 ms to boot before any of our code runs, measured as a 367 ms flash at logon.

  The .vbs resolves the watchdog next to itself, and the watchdog resolves the launcher
  next to itself, so all three relocate together and the module can live anywhere.

  Interactive logon is REQUIRED: the session hosts a real Windows Terminal window to
  attach to, and it is also what puts the user's module path in scope for the watchdog.
