  Inner launcher for one instance. Runs inside the hidden Windows Terminal
  window the watchdog created.

  It deliberately does NOT hide anything itself. The WT window is already born
  hidden via STARTUPINFO. Hiding the pseudo-console from in here was the mistake
  that made three earlier attempts look like they worked while a Windows Terminal
  window sat visible on screen.

# The working directory MUST NOT be the home directory. Per the Remote Control
# docs the startup trust dialog never persists trust for a home directory, so RC
# never connects and the trust prompt repeats forever. Claude Code also keys
# project state on the literal cwd string, which is why this is set explicitly
# rather than inherited from the task or the shell.
# Failing to reach it must be FATAL, not something to shrug off.
#
# $ErrorActionPreference is 'Continue' for this whole script, so before this both
# the New-Item and the Set-Location could fail, print to a stream nobody reads,
# and let execution carry on. claude then launched in whatever directory the
# process inherited -- which is the task's working directory, $env:USERPROFILE.
# The home directory. The one place Remote Control provably will not connect
# from, and the exact condition the comment above warns about.

# That is reachable for real: a working directory on a network share is not
# guaranteed to be mapped when the logon task fires. The session would come up,
# look alive to the watchdog, and never connect -- silently, in a hidden window.
#
# Exiting non-zero instead means the watchdog logs that the session did not come
# up and eventually trips its crash-loop backoff. Noisy in the log beats wrong on

# tell them apart by title. Without --name the title is Claude Code's own: it
# starts as "Claude Code" and becomes the CONVERSATION title once the conversation
# has one, changing as the conversation changes. Neither is tied to the instance,
# which is why matching on the working-directory leaf finds nothing against a live
# session.
#
# Measured on the reference host: --name drives the title, and it holds even when

# was last running is what it keeps, across restarts and reboots, indefinitely -- and a
# settings-file default will not dislodge it. --model at launch does, and nothing else
# reachable from here does.
#
# It sets the model the session STARTS with, not a guarantee for its lifetime: a session
# can still be moved afterwards, and the CLI itself can fall back to a different model
# when it flags a message. greenroom cannot read the live model, so it does not claim to.

# Continue the previous conversation rather than minting a new session id on every
# restart. Without this, each watchdog restart begins a fresh conversation, and every
# one of them shows up as a separate entry in the Claude Desktop session list. On the
# reference host nine accumulated in a single day; eight were ~1 KB stubs holding
# nothing but a session header.
#
# The conversation is pinned BY ID rather than reached for by recency. Measured on
# 2.1.218 and re-checked on 2.1.220:
#
#   --session-id <uuid> on EVERY launch
#       Create-only. The second launch exits 1 with "Session ID ... is already in
#       use". Pinning it unconditionally works exactly once and fails on every
#       restart thereafter -- inside a hidden window, so the watchdog crash-loops
#       with nothing on screen. That is why it appears below only on the FIRST
#       launch, where create is exactly the operation wanted.
#
#   -c with NO prior transcript
#       Exits 1 under --remote-control. This is the trap: `claude -p ... -c` in an
#       empty directory succeeds, so a headless test proves nothing about the path
#       this launcher actually takes. The interactive/RC path needs something to
#       continue and fails without it.
#
#   -c WITH a prior transcript
#       Session comes up, the existing transcript is appended to, no fork.
#
# -c is nevertheless the WRONG primitive here, and this is the bug it caused:
# it continues the NEWEST transcript in the project store, not this instance's.
# Anything else that ran claude in this directory -- a hand-started session, most
# obviously -- leaves a newer transcript, and the next restart silently adopts it.
# Two processes then append to one transcript with no error and no detection.
# See docs/greenroom-cutover.md.
#
# So: settle on an id once and keep resuming that exact id. --resume reuses the
# original session id rather than forking (forking is opt-in, via --fork-session), so
# the id stays stable across every restart for the life of the instance.
#
# Where an instance starts a directory that ALREADY holds conversations, the first
# launch adopts the newest and pins it. Recency is used exactly once, to pick a
# starting point; identity governs every launch after. That is bootstrap rather than
# migration -- it is as true of a fresh install into a directory you have been using
# by hand as it is of an instance that predates the pin.
#
# The guard keeps the same SHAPE as the -c guard it replaces -- do not resume what
# does not exist, or the hidden window crash-loops -- but is keyed to identity rather
# than recency. See Resolve-InstanceConversation.ps1 next door for the branches.
#
# The slug is derived from Get-Location AFTER Set-Location rather than from
# $cfg.workingDirectory: Claude Code keys the project store on the LITERAL cwd
# string, with every non-alphanumeric character replaced by a dash. Deriving it from
# the resolved location is what keeps the two in agreement.
