.SYNOPSIS
  Get the greenroom sessions running on this host.

.DESCRIPTION
  Emits one object per running session. This is the module replacement for
  `greenroom list` and `greenroom status`, which were separate verbs only because a
  script had to choose its own output shape -- `list` piped through
  Format-Table -AutoSize and `status` printed a block of text.

  The difference is not cosmetic. `greenroom list` wrote FORMATTED TEXT to the host,
  so anything downstream received formatting records rather than data:

      PS> greenroom status laptop-admin | ForEach-Object { "  $_" }
        Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.FormatStartData
        Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.GroupStartData
        ...

  That is measured output from this repository's own tooling. Emitting objects and
  leaving presentation to Greenroom.format.ps1xml makes the table a VIEW of the data
  rather than the only thing produced, so filtering works:

      Get-GreenroomInstance | Where-Object Elevated
      Get-GreenroomInstance | Where-Object { -not $_.Visible } | Show-GreenroomSession

.PARAMETER Name
  Only return instances with this name. Wildcards are supported.

.EXAMPLE
  Get-GreenroomInstance

.EXAMPLE
  Get-GreenroomInstance -Name laptop-admin | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Window

.EXAMPLE
  Get-GreenroomInstance | Where-Object { $_.Window -eq $null }
  Instances whose window could not be resolved. Add -Verbose for the reason each.

.OUTPUTS
